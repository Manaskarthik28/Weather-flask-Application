The unpredictable and varied weather patterns of Seattle present both challenges and opportunities for residents, tourists, and businesses alike. Understanding and predicting these weather phenomena are crucial for effective planning and decision-making. This study aims to leverage machine learning techniques, particularly decision tree classifier algorithms, to forecast Seattle's weather patterns with greater accuracy and reliability. By analysing a comprehensive dataset encompassing historical weather data, including precipitation levels, temperature variations, and wind patterns, this research seeks to develop a robust predictive model. Such a model not only enhances our understanding of Seattle's dynamic climate but also provides valuable insights for urban planning, disaster preparedness, and tourism management. Through the application of advanced computational methods, this project endeavours to contribute to the broader discourse on weather prediction and its implications for societal resilience and sustainability.
